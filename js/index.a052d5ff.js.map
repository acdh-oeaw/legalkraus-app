Für Kraus umfasste die Kategorie der ‚Richtigkeit‘ neben inhaltlicher Elemente aber auch die Wiedergabe seiner Texte bis in die Details der Orthografie und Interpunktion, wie die hier aufgelisteten Akten dokumentieren.

Zwar entschied er sich früh gegen eine Schauspielkarriere, begann aber 1910 mit regelmäßigen Vorlesungen, die bis zu seinem Lebensende einen großen Teil seines Ruhmes begründen sollten und ihn in die Kulturzentren Europas führten. Auf seinem „Theater der Dichtung“ pflegte Kraus aber nicht nur seine eigenen Texte zu präsentieren, sondern bemühte sich neben vielen anderen um Shakespeare, Goethe, Nestroy und Offenbach.

Auch wenn der\n        Satiriker bei seinen berühmten Vorlesungen die Bühne nicht scheute, so\n        lehnte es Kraus doch ab, in der Öffentlichkeit fotografiert zu werden.\n        Mit Akte 182 ist nicht nur diese Abneigung überliefert, sondern auch\n        eine ausführlichere Begründung dieser: In einer eidesstattlichen\n        Versicherung erläuterte Kraus, inwiefern ihm das Recht am eigenen Bild\n        obliege. Ging Kraus zwar selbst mit Eifer gegen den Abdruck seines\n        Abbildes vor, verhielt es sich bei Fotografien und Abbildungen anderer\n        Personen jedoch nicht so. In Akte 167 ist dokumentiert, wie Kraus und\n        Samek im umgekehrten Fall auch gegen den Besitzanspruch einer Fotografie\n        argumentieren konnten. So waren beide der Meinung, dass die\n        Veröffentlichung einer Fotografie des Sportfotografen Lothar Rübelts in\n        der <i>Fackel</i> nicht inkriminierbar sei (und bekamen vom Obersten\n        Gerichtshof auch Recht).\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'verlage-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Kraus und Samek gingen zwar in der Mehrzahl gegen Zeitungen im\n        deutschsprachigen Raum vor, in einigen Fällen kommt es aber auch zu\n        juristischen Streitigkeiten mit zum Teil noch heute bestehenden\n        Verlagshäusern. Von Bedeutung ist etwa die Auseinandersetzung mit dem\n        Fischer-Verlag, bei dem Kraus eigentlich die Werke seines verstorbenen\n        Freundes Peter Altenberg hatte herausgeben wollen. Die Publikation\n        musste aber schließlich wegen Unstimmigkeiten bei Anton Schroll in Wien\n        erscheinen. Ebenso von Interesse ist die Akte zum Streit über die\n        letztlich gescheiterte Wiederauflage der\n        <i>Letzten Tage der Menschheit</i> durch den Knaur-Verlag, der das\n        erfolgreiche Werk in einer Sonderausgabe groß herausbringen wollte. In\n        diesem Fall ist außerdem durch einen 22 Seiten langen Entwurf einer\n        handschriftlich von Kraus verfassten Privatklage belegt, dass der\n        Satiriker an der Formulierung juristischer Texte maßgeblich beteiligt\n        war. An der recht umfangreichen Korrespondenz dieser und anderer Fälle,\n        in denen Verlagshäuser involviert waren, lässt sich außerdem\n        nachvollziehen, wie die Verlagshäuser damals mit ökonomischen Zwängen\n        umgingen.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'tageblatt-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Die Akten zu den Auseinandersetzungen im Umfeld des\n        <i>Berliner Tageblatts</i> gehören nicht nur zu den umfangreichsten,\n        sondern sie sind auch die in der <i>Fackel</i> im größten Umfang\n        zitierten. Ausgehend von den 1926 begonnenen Streitigkeiten mit dem\n        erfolgreichen Literaturkritiker und Redakteur des\n        <i>Berliner Tageblatts</i> Alfred Kerr, die neben Beleidigungen auch\n        dessen angebliche Kriegslyrik zum Gegenstand hatten, mündete diese\n        große, ursprünglich gegen eine einzige Person begonnene Kampagne in\n        gleich mehrere juristische Auseinandersetzungen. Ab 1928 gingen nämlich\n        Kraus und seine Berliner Anwälte gegen den Verlag (Rudolf Mosse) und ab\n        1931 auch gegen die Redaktion des <i>Berliner Tageblatts</i>, eine der\n        meistgelesenen Tageszeitungen Deutschlands, vor. 1929 klagte Kraus\n        schließlich noch gegen deren Herausgeber Theodor Wolff. Meistens ging es\n        hierbei um Ehrenbeleidigungen, die sich beide Parteien ununterbrochen\n        vorwarfen. Weiterhin forderte Kraus Berichtigungen. Letztlich hat er\n        aber aus keiner anderen Akte der über 200 Fälle in der <i>Fackel</i> so\n        umfangreich zitiert wie aus der Akte 68. Nachdem sein Anwalt Viktor\n        Fraenkl einem Vergleich im Kerr-Prozess 1928 ohne Kraus’ Erlaubnis\n        zugestimmt hatte, nahm Kraus diese für ihn schwer zu ertragende Schmach\n        nicht nur zum Anlass, sich von Fraenkl als Anwalt zu trennen, sondern\n        gleichfalls die relevanten Akten zum Fall Kerr noch im selben Jahr in\n        einer fast über 200 Seiten langen <i>Fackel</i> zu veröffentlichen.\n        Kraus versuchte also, von den juristischen Auseinandersetzungen nicht\n        nur für seinen polemischen Kampf zu profitieren, sondern er nutzte diese\n        auch, um ihren Stoff satirisch-literarisch zu verarbeiten. Diese\n        publizistische Fortführung machte ihm Theodor Wolff schließlich zum\n        Vorwurf, der glaubte, Kraus wolle sich mit der lancierten Kampagne gegen\n        einen der bekanntesten Literaturkritiker Deutschlands lediglich zu einer\n        größeren Leserschaft seiner Zeitschrift verhelfen.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'schober-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Die gegen den Wiener Polizeipräfekten Johann Schober geführte Kampagne\n        schließt direkt an die gegen Emmerich Békessy an. Kraus wollte, nachdem\n        er bereits Békessy erfolgreich aus Wien vertrieben hatte, nun auch den\n        Hauptverantwortlichen für den blutigen Ausgang der Demonstrationen am\n        15. Juli 1927 aus der Stadt verbannen. Dafür versuchte Kraus unter\n        anderem, Schober vor ein Gericht zu bringen. 1928 war es soweit: Kraus\n        klagte gegen Schober wegen Ehrenbeleidigung und erzielte endlich einen\n        Prozess. Das Strafbezirksgericht I Wien sprach Schober allerdings von\n        der Anklage frei. Da Samek und Kraus nicht in Berufung gingen, ist die\n        Akte zum Fall Schober mit 13 Dokumenten verhältnismäßig dünn. Weitere\n        Akten überliefern aber Streitigkeiten im Kontext der Schober-Kampagne\n        wie etwa die Falschzitierung des von Kraus in der Wiener Innenstadt\n        angebrachten Plakats, mit dem er Schober aufforderte, als\n        Polizeipräsident abzutreten, oder aber die nicht-rechtliche polizeiliche\n        Konfiszierung des <i>Fackel</i>-Sonderheftes mit dem „Schoberlied“. Die\n        Auseinandersetzungen rund um den Wiener Polizeipräfekten sind vor allem\n        deshalb relevant, da sie einen wichtigen Einblick in die polemischen\n        Praktiken bei Kraus ermöglichen. Wie schon bei Kerr und Bekessy genügte\n        es dem Satiriker nicht, nur mittels Schrift gegen das in seinen Augen\n        unmoralische oder korrupte Handeln vorzugehen. Plakate, Vorlesungen,\n        Prozesse, Lieder sowie schriftliche Polemiken in der <i>Fackel</i> waren\n        allesamt strategische Mittel im Kampf gegen Schober.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'christlich-sozial-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Obwohl Kraus nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg politisch eher der\n        Sozialdemokratie zugeneigt war, ging er gegen Zeitungen aus dem\n        konservativen Spektrum nicht so häufig vor wie gegen die\n        linksgerichteten. Nur drei Akten dokumentieren juristische Vorgehen\n        gegen die christlich-soziale <i>Reichspost</i>. Interessanterweise ging\n        Kraus gegen diese gleich zu Beginn seiner Zusammenarbeit mit Oskar Samek\n        vor. 1922 forderten sie eine Berichtigung von Tatsachen, da die\n        <i>Reichspost</i> den <i>Fackel</i>-Aufsatz „Ein Kreislauf“ falsch\n        zitiert hatte. Als die Redaktion die Berichtigung nicht gebracht hatte,\n        prozessierte Kraus. Er ging zwar in die zweite Instanz, verlor aber\n        schließlich diesen Prozess. Ein Jahr darauf versuchten Kraus und Samek\n        erneut, gegen die <i>Reichspost</i> aufgrund einer nicht erbrachten\n        Berichtigung zu klagen. Doch auch diese Klage blieb erfolglos. Dass\n        Kraus erst wieder gegen die <i>Reichspost</i> juristisch vorging, als\n        diese 1927 über die Plakatierung des Schober-Plakates falsch berichtet\n        hatte, ist in Anbetracht der häufigen Berichtigungsforderungen (etwa an\n        das unparteiische <i>Neue Wiener Journal</i> oder an die\n        <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i>) beachtlich. Auch dieser Berichtigungsforderung\n        kam die <i>Reichspost</i> nicht nach und Kraus klagte ein drittes Mal\n        ohne Erfolg. In der <i>Fackel</i> positionierte sich Kraus wiederum klar\n        gegen die <i>Reichspost</i>, die Schobers am 15. Juli 1927 erlassenen\n        Schießbefehl in der Verteidigung Wiens gerechtfertigt sah. Er zitierte\n        unter anderem ihre verherrlichenden Berichte über den\n        Reichsjustizpalastbrand, die nach Kraus eben nicht für eine\n        christlich-soziale Gesinnung standen. Obwohl die\n        <i>Reichspost</i> kritisch über Kraus’ Kampagne gegen Schober\n        berichtete, sind in den Rechtsakten keine weiteren juristischen\n        Auseinandersetzungen mit der Zeitung überliefert.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'nationalsozialismus-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Drei Akten bezeugen Kraus’ Kampf gegen die nationalsozialistischen sowie\n        antisemitischen Tendenzen zwischen 1927 und 1929. In diesem Zeitraum\n        ging Kraus sowohl gegen den <i>Volkskampf</i> als auch gegen den <i>Völkischen\n        Beobachter</i> vor. Beide Zeitungen waren nationalsozialistisch\n        ausgerichtet. Meistens bildeten beleidigende Provokationen, die Kraus’\n        Judentum betrafen, unwahre Behauptungen oder absichtliche Falschzitate\n        die Grundlage für juristische Interventionen. Zwei geforderte\n        Berichtigungen wurden im <i>Volkskampf</i> sogar tatsächlich gebracht und auch\n        bei den zwei Ehrenbeleidigungsklagen wurde Kraus Recht gegeben.\n        Allerdings suchten diese Zeitungen oft Wege, Kraus erneut zu demütigen.\n        Im Falle des <i>Volkskampf</i>, in dem die geforderten Berichtigungen\n        gleichzeitig auch beleidigende Bemerkungen enthielten, unterließ Kraus\n        eine weitere Berichtigung. Er reichte auch nicht die Klage aufgrund\n        eines möglichen Verstoßes gegen das Pressegesetz ein, das eigentlich\n        vorschrieb, geforderte Berichtigungen ohne Zusätze zu drucken. Bei einer\n        anderen Zeitung mit demselben Vorgehen hätte Kraus wohl geklagt.\n        Offenbar entschlossen aber Kraus und seine Anwälte sich dazu, sich\n        diesen Zeitungen dann doch nicht weiter zu widmen.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Akte 189 nach März 1933 dokumentiert schließlich exemplarisch die\n        publizistische Reaktion auf Kraus’ ‚Verstummen‘. Dass Kraus auf die\n        nationalsozialistische Machtergreifung in Deutschland nur mit einem\n        Gedicht und der Grabrede auf Adolf Loos reagierte, verärgerte etliche so\n        sehr, dass im Gegenzug einige Zeitungen Nachrufe auf Karl Kraus drucken\n        ließen. Die Zeitschrift <i>Gegen-Angriff</i> druckte zusätzlich noch das\n        Gedicht „Man frage nicht“ und vergaß dabei, ein Komma zu setzen, weshalb\n        Kraus die Berichtigung forderte. Ehrenbeleidigungsklagen und weitere\n        Berichtigungsforderungen folgten. Der <i>Gegen-Angriff</i> beleidigte daraufhin\n        Kraus weiterhin und zog seinen Kampf ums Komma ins Lächerliche. Während\n        Bertolt Brecht noch sowohl für Kraus’ knapp sieben Monate langes\n        Verstummen als auch für die Publikation der Grabrede und des Gedichts\n        als erste Reaktion auf die Machtergreifung Verständnis hatte, änderte\n        sich seine befürwortende Haltung gänzlich mit der Publikation „Warum die\n        Fackel nicht erscheint“ (1934). Kraus’ darin geäußerte Kritik gegen die\n        Sozialdemokraten sowie die klare Positionierung für das Dollfuß-Regime\n        isolierten ihn schließlich noch mehr als sein Verstummen 1933.\n

Dabei werden Schreib- bzw. Tippfehler ignoriert, da nicht die Fehleranfälligkeit der Schreiber:innen dokumentiert werden sollte. Gleiches Verfahren wurde bei den juristischen Dokumenten aus den Gerichten, etwa bei Urteilsschriften, angewendet, da hier kein Autor, wie es bspw. bei Briefen der Fall ist, zu bestimmen war, und diese Edition primär den Informationsgehalt des Urteils vermitteln soll.</p>\n<p>Innerhalb der Projektlaufzeit blieb nach Abschluss der Kodierung lediglich Zeit für einen Lektorats- bzw. Korrektoratsdurchgang.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"font-weight-bold\">Allgemeine Transkriptionsregeln</p>\n\n<p>Die Dokumente wurden zeilengenau transkribiert. Bei mehrspaltigem Satz werden die Spalteninhalte durch Absätze voneinander getrennt.</p>\n<p>Späte Änderungen, die oft handschriftlich erfolgt sind, wurden stets berücksichtigt, da sie die Korrekturabläufe transparent machen und zeigen, dass Anwalt und Mandant, mitunter auch sehr intensiv, an den Texten im Nachhinein gearbeitet haben. Tippfehler, die sofort geändert wurden, sind hingegen nicht ediert, da nicht die Schreibfähigkeit der Schreiber:innen dokumentiert werden soll. Falsche Schreibweisen von Namen wurden allerdings konsequent wiedergegeben. Grundsätzlich wurden nur den Wortlaut betreffende sowie spätere handschriftliche interpunktionelle und orthografische Änderungen wiedergegeben, Sofortänderungen der Orthografie und Interpunktion wurden hingegen nicht aufgenommen.</p>\n<p>Der Briefkopf in Korrespondenzen (der neben dem Datum, den Adressen der am Schriftstück beteiligten Personen ebenso einen Betreff und eine Diktatsigle enthalten kann) wurde in den Metadaten erfasst, nicht aber transkribiert. Stempel der gerichtlichen Dokumente wurden nicht transkribiert, aber in den Metadaten erfasst.</p>\n<p>Sperrungen und Unterstreichungen sind grundsätzlich als solche differenziert wiedergegeben, weil beide Hervorhebungen mitunter auch im selben Exemplar vorkommen können. Anführungszeichen sind einheitlich und typografisch korrekt (also nicht mimetisch) wiedergegeben, um die Lesbarkeit der Dokumente, in denen häufig zitiert wurde, zu gewährleisten. Auch die zum Teil gebräuchliche Schreibweise bei Preisangaben durch zwei Bindestriche wurde durch ein Halbgeviert angepasst. Verschleifungen bei Unterschriften wurden aufgelöst. Seiten- und Blattzählungen, Dittografien und Kustoden werden nicht wiedergegeben. Spatien zwischen Abkürzungen wurden einheitlich nicht gesetzt. Unvollständige Datumsangaben bzw. Teile davon wurden ergänzt, da diese bei Durchschlägen oft fehlen, auf dem Typoskript allerdings auf dem vorbedruckten Briefpapier vorhanden waren. Eigentümliche Schreibweisen wie bspw. die Verwendung eines Versal-„J“ anstelle des Versal-„I“ wurden normalisiert. Editorische Hinzufügungen wurden mit eckigen Klammern gekennzeichnet. Für unleserliche Buchstaben und Wörter sind (mehrere) „[¿]“ gesetzt.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"font-weight-bold\">Schreibmaterial</p>\n\n<p>Wurde in einem maschinell erstellten Dokument handschriftlich geändert, so ist dieser Wechsel des Schreibmaterials in der Transkription dargestellt sowie in den Metadaten genauer beschrieben, indem Schreiberhände und Schreibmaterial mitgeteilt sind. Bei nachträglichen handschriftlichen Hinzufügungen am Dokument wurde außerdem in der Darstellung unterschieden, ob es sich um eine handschriftliche Notiz bzw. Hervorhebung durch Marginalien am Rande handelt oder ob tatsächlich eine Änderung am Text vorgenommen wurde. Handschriftlich gesetzte Unterschriften wurden nicht als solche extra ausgezeichnet. Sogenannte Kanzleivermerke, die in der Regel ebenfalls handschriftlich und meistens am Ende eines Dokuments angebracht wurden, sind einheitlich differenziert in der Transkription wiedergegeben.</p>\n\n<p>Durch die synoptische Darstellung ist die Transkription an jeder Stelle mit dem Original überprüfbar.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font-weight-bold\">Nicht transkribierte Dokumente und Akten</p>\n\n<p>Sämtliche Zeitungstexte, Originalmappen, -umschläge und Aktenvermerke sowie Kostenbestimmungen, Rückscheine, Rechnungen, Ladungen und weitere vorbedruckte Dokumente wurden nicht transkribiert, sondern mittels Faksimile dargestellt und durch die Angabe ihrer Metadaten erfasst. Die von Kraus und Samek angelegten Aktensammlungen zu Emmerich Békessy (Akten 43–59) wurden nicht ediert, da es sich hier meistens um Materialien zu Prozessen anderer Anwälte und ihrer Klienten handelt. Die Akten 204–215, bei denen es sich primär um separat abgelegte Kontextmaterialien handelt, wurden ebenfalls nicht ediert.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font-weight-bold\">Materialitäts- und Dokumentstypen</p>\n\n<p>Allen edierten Dokumenten wurden in den Metadaten Materialitäts- und Dokumentstypen zugeordnet, die auf einer für das Projekt und den Aktenbestand speziell erarbeiteten Taxonomie basieren. Liegt ein Dokument in der Mappe nur als archivarische Kopie vor, wurde der Materialitätstyp „Kopie“ ergänzt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font-weight-bold\">Intertextualität und weitere Referenzen</p>\n\n<p>Der Projektausrichtung und zentralen Forschungsfrage gemäß wurden im transkribierten Text mehrere Auszeichnungen vorgenommen. Alle identifizierbaren Werke und Zitate aus Rechtstexten, die in <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://alex.onb.ac.at/\"><i>ALEX</i></a> (Service der Österreichischen Nationalbibliothek) mit Digitalisaten zu historischen Rechts- und Gesetzestexten enthalten sind, wurden referenziert. Nicht ermittelte Werke und Zitate wurden als solche ausgezeichnet. Außerdem wurden Zitate und Werke aus der <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://fackel.oeaw.ac.at\"><i>Fackel</i></a> seitengetreu referenziert. Darüber hinaus sind Zitate aus anderen, in den Rechtsakten enthaltenen Dokumenten bzw. die Dokumente selbst ausgezeichnet und referenziert.</p>\n<p>Ein Sonderfall der Auszeichnung stellen jene in den Akten enthaltenen Textpassagen dar, die zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt in der <i>Fackel</i> veröffentlicht wurden und somit Teil eines literarischen Textes wurden. Diese sogenannten <i>Fackel</i>-Intertexte sind, soweit sie identifizierbar waren, rot hervorgehoben und mit einem Verweis auf die entsprechende Stelle in der <i>Fackel</i> referenziert.</p>\n\n<p>In den Transkriptionen werden neben den Intertextualitätsreferenzen weitere Entitäten wie Personen, Orte, Institutionen ausgezeichnet.</p>\n\n<p>Für Beispiele zu den beschriebenen Auszeichnungen siehe

USSR/Russia between 1945 and 2017. The number of nuclear weapons is plotted on the Y-axis and the years on the X-axis. The chart is interactive, and the year-on-year stockpile levels can be traced for each country. The US has a stockpile of 6 nuclear weapons at the dawn of the nuclear age in 1945. This number has gradually increased to 369 by 1950 when the USSR enters the arms race with 6 weapons. At this point, the US starts to rapidly build its stockpile culminating in 32,040 warheads by 1966 compared to the USSR’s 7,089. From this peak in 1966, the US stockpile gradually decreases as the USSR’s stockpile expands. By 1978 the USSR has closed the nuclear gap at 25,393. The USSR stockpile continues to grow until it reaches a peak of 45,000 in 1986 compared to the US arsenal of 24,401. From 1986, the nuclear stockpiles of both countries start to fall. By 2000, the numbers have fallen to 10,577 and 21,000 for the US and Russia, respectively. The decreases continue until 2017 at which point the US holds 4,018 weapons compared to Russia’s 4,500.\",\n        },\n        title: {\n          text: this.title,\n        },\n        subtitle: {\n
