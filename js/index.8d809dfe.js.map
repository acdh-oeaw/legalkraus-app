Zum anderen wird an ihnen aber\n        auch deutlich, welche Prozesse und Berichtigungen Kraus, indem er sie in\n        der <i>Fackel</i> thematisierte, einer breiteren Öffentlichkeit\n        zugänglich machen wollte.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Manche Aktenstücke benutzte Kraus, um erfolgte Berichtigungen in der\n        <i>Fackel</i> zu dokumentieren (etwa in den Akten 39 und 119\n        ersichtlich). Solche Berichtigungen konnten auch den Anlass zu einem\n        satirischen Text geben, wie anhand Akte 160 nachvollzogen werden kann.\n        Teilweise griff Kraus zu drastischeren Maßnahmen: Die Akte 68 zum Fall\n        Kerr wird in großem Umfang in der berühmten Nummer 787–794 zitiert. So\n        zeigt sich Kraus in seiner nicht unproblematischen Rolle als\n        gleichzeitiger Kämpfer auf zwei Schlachtfeldern: der Publizistik und dem\n        Gerichtssaal.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'berichtigung-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Der § 23 des Bundesgesetzes vom 7. Dezember 1922 über die Presse\n        („Preßgesetz“) erlaubte Karl Kraus, verantwortliche Schriftleiter der\n        Zeitungen und Zeitschriften zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen, wenn jene\n        falsche Tatsachen im Druck mitteilten – im heutigen Medienrecht ist dies\n        vergleichbar mit dem Recht zur „Gegendarstellung“. Für Kraus umfasste\n        die Kategorie der ‚Richtigkeit‘ neben inhaltlicher Elemente aber auch\n        die Wiedergabe seiner Texte bis in die Details der Orthografie und\n        Interpunktion, wie die hier aufgelisteten Akten dokumentieren. Der\n        Schriftsteller und sein Anwalt zeigen sich als höchst genaue Leser und\n        konsequente Berichtiger – nicht selten den Spott derjenigen\n        hervorrufend, die gezwungen waren, die Berichtigungen zu\n        veröffentlichen.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Ein frühes Beispiel dafür ist Akte 2, in der Kraus und Samek nach nicht\n        erfolgter Berichtigung eines satirischen Textes über Kraus’ religiösen\n        „Kreislauf“ die <i>Reichspost</i> – letztlich erfolglos – klagten. Als\n        Komplex innerhalb der hier präsentierten Auswahl können zudem die Akten\n        187 und 189 angesehen werden, die aus den berichtigten Zitationen des\n        Gedichtes „Man frage nicht“ (Oktober 1933) hervorgingen.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'theater-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Als Schriftsteller, der sein Schreiben als „geschriebene\n        Schauspielkunst“ verstanden wissen wollte, stand Karl Kraus dem Theater\n        besonders nahe. Zwar entschied er sich früh gegen eine\n        Schauspielkarriere, begann aber 1910 mit regelmäßigen Vorlesungen, die\n        bis zu seinem Lebensende einen großen Teil seines Ruhmes begründen\n        sollten und ihn in die Kulturzentren Europas führten. Auf seinem\n        „Theater der Dichtung“ pflegte Kraus aber nicht nur seine eigenen Texte\n        zu präsentieren, sondern bemühte sich neben vielen anderen um\n        Shakespeare, Goethe, Nestroy und Offenbach. So gilt Kraus als\n        (Haupt-)Verantwortlicher für die ‚Renaissance‘ der beiden letztgenannten\n        Künstler, von deren Werken er seit 1920 auch textliche Bearbeitungen\n        publizierte. Diese wurden von verschiedenen Bühnen als Grundlage für\n        eigene Aufführungen verwendet. Nicht autorisierte Streichungen, also\n        Urheberrechtsverletzungen, und vorzeitige Absetzungen führten dabei zu\n        Konflikten, wie an den Akten 120, 158 und 173 ersichtlich ist.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Aber auch in Verbindung mit der Aufführung eigener Dramen kam es zu\n        juristischen Interventionen, wie beispielsweise an Akte 10\n        nachzuvollziehen, in der Kraus nach erfolgreicher Klage eine\n        Tantiemenauszahlung der Neuen Wiener Bühne zur Spende für ein kürzlich\n        geschehenes Bergwerksunglück erzwingen konnte.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'stunde-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Die wohl größte erfolgreiche Kampagne seines Lebens führte Karl Kraus\n        gegen den Journalisten Imre Békessy. Dessen beim Lesepublikum sehr\n        beliebte illustrierte Tageszeitung <i>Die Stunde</i> begann bereits\n        1925, im dritten Kalenderjahr ihres Erscheinens, Kraus durch\n        Falschmeldungen, retuschierte Fotografien bzw. herabsetzende\n        Fotomontagen zu attackieren – und so den zuvor in der\n        <i>Fackel</i> eröffneten Kampf anzunehmen. Bei diesen Schmähartikeln tat\n        sich ganz besonders der Stegreifredner und Satiriker Anton Kuh hervor\n        (Akte 19), den Samek und Kraus später noch mit besonderer Ausdauer\n        juristisch verfolgen sollten. Bis zur Eskalation und der Flucht Békessys\n        nach Paris 1926 strengte Kraus – teilweise gemeinsam mit seiner\n        Schwester Marie Turnowsky (Akten 13, 14) oder mit dem\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Sozialdemokraten Friedrich Austerlitz (Akten 40, 41) – eine Vielzahl\n        Untersuchungen und Prozesse gegen Békessy, den Redaktionsstab sowie den\n        Verlag der <i>Stunde</i> [Kronos-Verlag A.G.] an. [Über die Kraus\n        konkret betreffenden, hier aufgeführten Fälle hinaus enthalten die\n        Rechtsakten Sameks auch eine große Sammlung von Korrespondenzen und\n        weiteren Akten, die Kraus’ Bemühungen um Beweissammlung mit dem Zweck\n        der vollständigen juristischen Erledigung Békessys weiter\n        dokumentieren.]\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'sozialdemokratie-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Obgleich der auf seiner Parteilosigkeit beharrende Karl Kraus sich im\n        einzigen von ihm publizierten Wahlaufruf im Februar 1919 für die\n        Sozialdemokratie aussprach, zeigen viele der durch Samek überlieferten\n        Akten einen facettenreichen Kampf gegen die Partei und ihr Presseorgan,\n        die <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i>. Dabei ging es in erster Linie um\n        Berichtigungen von Zeitungsartikeln in verschiedenen Publikationen, die\n        Kraus’ Verhältnis zur Partei und ihrer Vertreter oder seine Vorlesungen\n        in sozialdemokratischen Veranstaltungsräumen thematisierten (besonders\n        an Akten 37–39 exemplarisch nachvollziehbar). Satirische Angriffe auf\n        Sozialdemokraten und ihre Kulturpolitik in den 1920er Jahren bescherten\n        Kraus aber auch schmähende Artikel in seine Richtung, gegen die er\n        wiederum durch Berichtigungen und Ehrenbeleidigungsklagen vorging (Akten\n        25–27, 66, 67). Als Ausnahme zwar, gleichwohl aber als Zeichen der sich\n        auch innerhalb der Sphäre des Rechts ausdrückenden Solidarität kann ein\n        in Akte 88 dokumentierter Klagerückzug Kraus’ nach dem Massaker vom 15.\n        Juli 1927 verstanden werden. Die späteren umfangreichen Akten 187, 193\n        und 196 dokumentieren die langwierigen Auseinandersetzungen mit der\n        sozialdemokratischen Presse anlässlich des ‚Verstummens‘ Kraus’ und der\n        Publikation seiner polarisierenden längsten <i>Fackel</i> Nr. 890–905 im\n        Juni 1934.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'medienhistorisches-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Handeln die meisten Fälle der Rechtsakten von Berichtigungsforderungen\n        oder Ehrenbeleidigungen, so gibt es doch wenige, in denen Bildrechte\n        Gegenstand juristischer Auseinandersetzungen sind. Meistens ging Kraus\n        hier gegen die publizistische Verwendung seines Abbildes wie etwa in\n        Akte 188 vor, welche die Durchsetzung des Verbots, Kraus auf Lesezeichen\n        der Zigarettenfirma Olleschau abzubilden, dokumentiert. Er ging aber\n        auch gemeinsam mit seiner Schwester Marie Turnowsky gegen die\n        Verfälschung einer in der Boulevard-Zeitung\n        <i>Die Stunde</i> publizierten Fotografie der beiden vor. Auch wenn der\n        Satiriker bei seinen berühmten Vorlesungen die Bühne nicht scheute, so\n        lehnte es Kraus doch ab, in der Öffentlichkeit fotografiert zu werden.\n        Mit Akte 182 ist nicht nur diese Abneigung überliefert, sondern auch\n        eine ausführlichere Begründung dieser: In einer eidesstattlichen\n        Versicherung erläuterte Kraus, inwiefern ihm das Recht am eigenen Bild\n        obliege. Ging Kraus zwar selbst mit Eifer gegen den Abdruck seines\n        Abbildes vor, verhielt es sich bei Fotografien und Abbildungen anderer\n        Personen jedoch nicht so. In Akte 167 ist dokumentiert, wie Kraus und\n        Samek im umgekehrten Fall auch gegen den Besitzanspruch einer Fotografie\n        argumentieren konnten. So waren beide der Meinung, dass die\n        Veröffentlichung einer Fotografie des Sportfotografen Lothar Rübelts in\n        der <i>Fackel</i> nicht inkriminierbar sei (und bekamen vom Obersten\n        Gerichtshof auch Recht).\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'verlage-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Kraus und Samek gingen zwar in der Mehrzahl gegen Zeitungen im\n        deutschsprachigen Raum vor, in einigen Fällen kommt es aber auch zu\n        juristischen Streitigkeiten mit zum Teil noch heute bestehenden\n        Verlagshäusern. Von Bedeutung ist etwa die Auseinandersetzung mit dem\n        Fischer-Verlag, bei dem Kraus eigentlich die Werke seines verstorbenen\n        Freundes Peter Altenberg hatte herausgeben wollen. Die Publikation\n        musste aber schließlich wegen Unstimmigkeiten bei Anton Schroll in Wien\n        erscheinen. Ebenso von Interesse ist die Akte zum Streit über die\n        letztlich gescheiterte Wiederauflage der\n        <i>Letzten Tage der Menschheit</i> durch den Knaur-Verlag, der das\n        erfolgreiche Werk in einer Sonderausgabe groß herausbringen wollte. In\n        diesem Fall ist außerdem durch einen 22 Seiten langen Entwurf einer\n        handschriftlich von Kraus verfassten Privatklage belegt, dass der\n        Satiriker an der Formulierung juristischer Texte maßgeblich beteiligt\n        war. An der recht umfangreichen Korrespondenz dieser und anderer Fälle,\n        in denen Verlagshäuser involviert waren, lässt sich außerdem\n        nachvollziehen, wie die Verlagshäuser damals mit ökonomischen Zwängen\n        umgingen.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'tageblatt-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Die Akten zu den Auseinandersetzungen im Umfeld des\n        <i>Berliner Tageblatts</i> gehören nicht nur zu den umfangreichsten,\n        sondern sie sind auch die in der <i>Fackel</i> im größten Umfang\n        zitierten. Ausgehend von den 1926 begonnenen Streitigkeiten mit dem\n        erfolgreichen Literaturkritiker und Redakteur des\n        <i>Berliner Tageblatts</i> Alfred Kerr, die neben Beleidigungen auch\n        dessen angebliche Kriegslyrik zum Gegenstand hatten, mündete diese\n        große, ursprünglich gegen eine einzige Person begonnene Kampagne in\n        gleich mehrere juristische Auseinandersetzungen. Ab 1928 gingen nämlich\n        Kraus und seine Berliner Anwälte gegen den Verlag (Rudolf Mosse) und ab\n        1931 auch gegen die Redaktion des <i>Berliner Tageblatts</i>, eine der\n        meistgelesenen Tageszeitungen Deutschlands, vor. 1929 klagte Kraus\n        schließlich noch gegen deren Herausgeber Theodor Wolff. Meistens ging es\n        hierbei um Ehrenbeleidigungen, die sich beide Parteien ununterbrochen\n        vorwarfen. Weiterhin forderte Kraus Berichtigungen. Letztlich hat er\n        aber aus keiner anderen Akte der über 200 Fälle in der <i>Fackel</i> so\n        umfangreich zitiert wie aus der Akte 68. Nachdem sein Anwalt Viktor\n        Fraenkl einem Vergleich im Kerr-Prozess 1928 ohne Kraus’ Erlaubnis\n        zugestimmt hatte, nahm Kraus diese für ihn schwer zu ertragende Schmach\n        nicht nur zum Anlass, sich von Fraenkl als Anwalt zu trennen, sondern\n        gleichfalls die relevanten Akten zum Fall Kerr noch im selben Jahr in\n        einer fast über 200 Seiten langen <i>Fackel</i> zu veröffentlichen.\n        Kraus versuchte also, von den juristischen Auseinandersetzungen nicht\n        nur für seinen polemischen Kampf zu profitieren, sondern er nutzte diese\n        auch, um ihren Stoff satirisch-literarisch zu verarbeiten. Diese\n        publizistische Fortführung machte ihm Theodor Wolff schließlich zum\n        Vorwurf, der glaubte, Kraus wolle sich mit der lancierten Kampagne gegen\n        einen der bekanntesten Literaturkritiker Deutschlands lediglich zu einer\n        größeren Leserschaft seiner Zeitschrift verhelfen.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'schober-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Die gegen den Wiener Polizeipräfekten Johann Schober geführte Kampagne\n        schließt direkt an die gegen Emmerich Békessy an. Kraus wollte, nachdem\n        er bereits Békessy erfolgreich aus Wien vertrieben hatte, nun auch den\n        Hauptverantwortlichen für den blutigen Ausgang der Demonstrationen am\n        15. Juli 1927 aus der Stadt verbannen. Dafür versuchte Kraus unter\n        anderem, Schober vor ein Gericht zu bringen. 1928 war es soweit: Kraus\n        klagte gegen Schober wegen Ehrenbeleidigung und erzielte endlich einen\n        Prozess. Das Strafbezirksgericht I Wien sprach Schober allerdings von\n        der Anklage frei. Da Samek und Kraus nicht in Berufung gingen, ist die\n        Akte zum Fall Schober mit 13 Dokumenten verhältnismäßig dünn. Weitere\n        Akten überliefern aber Streitigkeiten im Kontext der Schober-Kampagne\n        wie etwa die Falschzitierung des von Kraus in der Wiener Innenstadt\n        angebrachten Plakats, mit dem er Schober aufforderte, als\n        Polizeipräsident abzutreten, oder aber die nicht-rechtliche polizeiliche\n        Konfiszierung des <i>Fackel</i>-Sonderheftes mit dem „Schoberlied“. Die\n        Auseinandersetzungen rund um den Wiener Polizeipräfekten sind vor allem\n        deshalb relevant, da sie einen wichtigen Einblick in die polemischen\n        Praktiken bei Kraus ermöglichen. Wie schon bei Kerr und Bekessy genügte\n        es dem Satiriker nicht, nur mittels Schrift gegen das in seinen Augen\n        unmoralische oder korrupte Handeln vorzugehen. Plakate, Vorlesungen,\n        Prozesse, Lieder sowie schriftliche Polemiken in der <i>Fackel</i> waren\n        allesamt strategische Mittel im Kampf gegen Schober.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'christlich-sozial-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Obwohl Kraus nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg politisch eher der\n        Sozialdemokratie zugeneigt war, ging er gegen Zeitungen aus dem\n        konservativen Spektrum nicht so häufig vor wie gegen die\n        linksgerichteten. Nur drei Akten dokumentieren juristische Vorgehen\n        gegen die christlich-soziale <i>Reichspost</i>. Interessanterweise ging\n        Kraus gegen diese gleich zu Beginn seiner Zusammenarbeit mit Oskar Samek\n        vor. 1922 forderten sie eine Berichtigung von Tatsachen, da die\n        <i>Reichspost</i> den <i>Fackel</i>-Aufsatz „Ein Kreislauf“ falsch\n        zitiert hatte. Als die Redaktion die Berichtigung nicht gebracht hatte,\n        prozessierte Kraus. Er ging zwar in die zweite Instanz, verlor aber\n        schließlich diesen Prozess. Ein Jahr darauf versuchten Kraus und Samek\n        erneut, gegen die <i>Reichspost</i> aufgrund einer nicht erbrachten\n        Berichtigung zu klagen. Doch auch diese Klage blieb erfolglos. Dass\n        Kraus erst wieder gegen die <i>Reichspost</i> juristisch vorging, als\n        diese 1927 über die Plakatierung des Schober-Plakates falsch berichtet\n        hatte, ist in Anbetracht der häufigen Berichtigungsforderungen (etwa an\n        das unparteiische <i>Neue Wiener Journal</i> oder an die\n        <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i>) beachtlich. Auch dieser Berichtigungsforderung\n        kam die <i>Reichspost</i> nicht nach und Kraus klagte ein drittes Mal\n        ohne Erfolg. In der <i>Fackel</i> positionierte sich Kraus wiederum klar\n        gegen die <i>Reichspost</i>, die Schobers am 15. Juli 1927 erlassenen\n        Schießbefehl in der Verteidigung Wiens gerechtfertigt sah. Er zitierte\n        unter anderem ihre verherrlichenden Berichte über den\n        Reichsjustizpalastbrand, die nach Kraus eben nicht für eine\n        christlich-soziale Gesinnung standen. Obwohl die\n        <i>Reichspost</i> kritisch über Kraus’ Kampagne gegen Schober\n        berichtete, sind in den Rechtsakten keine weiteren juristischen\n        Auseinandersetzungen mit der Zeitung überliefert.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else-if=\"currentview === 'nationalsozialismus-collections'\">\n      <p>\n        Drei Akten bezeugen Kraus’ Kampf gegen die nationalsozialistischen sowie\n        antisemitischen Tendenzen zwischen 1927 und 1929. In diesem Zeitraum\n        ging Kraus sowohl gegen den <i>Volkskampf</i> als auch gegen den <i>Völkischen\n        Beobachter</i> vor. Beide Zeitungen waren nationalsozialistisch\n        ausgerichtet. Meistens bildeten beleidigende Provokationen, die Kraus’\n        Judentum betrafen, unwahre Behauptungen oder absichtliche Falschzitate\n        die Grundlage für juristische Interventionen. Zwei geforderte\n        Berichtigungen wurden im <i>Volkskampf</i> sogar tatsächlich gebracht und auch\n        bei den zwei Ehrenbeleidigungsklagen wurde Kraus Recht gegeben.\n        Allerdings suchten diese Zeitungen oft Wege, Kraus erneut zu demütigen.\n        Im Falle des <i>Volkskampf</i>, in dem die geforderten Berichtigungen\n        gleichzeitig auch beleidigende Bemerkungen enthielten, unterließ Kraus\n        eine weitere Berichtigung. Er reichte auch nicht die Klage aufgrund\n        eines möglichen Verstoßes gegen das Pressegesetz ein, das eigentlich\n        vorschrieb, geforderte Berichtigungen ohne Zusätze zu drucken. Bei einer\n        anderen Zeitung mit demselben Vorgehen hätte Kraus wohl geklagt.\n        Offenbar entschlossen aber Kraus und seine Anwälte sich dazu, sich\n        diesen Zeitungen dann doch nicht weiter zu widmen.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Akte 189 nach März 1933 dokumentiert schließlich exemplarisch die\n        publizistische Reaktion auf Kraus’ ‚Verstummen‘. Dass Kraus auf die\n        nationalsozialistische Machtergreifung in Deutschland nur mit einem\n        Gedicht und der Grabrede auf Adolf Loos reagierte, verärgerte etliche so\n        sehr, dass im Gegenzug einige Zeitungen Nachrufe auf Karl Kraus drucken\n        ließen. Die Zeitschrift <i>Gegen-Angriff</i> druckte zusätzlich noch das\n        Gedicht „Man frage nicht“ und vergaß dabei, ein Komma zu setzen, weshalb\n        Kraus die Berichtigung forderte. Ehrenbeleidigungsklagen und weitere\n        Berichtigungsforderungen folgten. Der <i>Gegen-Angriff</i> beleidigte daraufhin\n        Kraus weiterhin und zog seinen Kampf ums Komma ins Lächerliche. Während\n        Bertolt Brecht noch sowohl für Kraus’ knapp sieben Monate langes\n        Verstummen als auch für die Publikation der Grabrede und des Gedichts\n        als erste Reaktion auf die Machtergreifung Verständnis hatte, änderte\n        sich seine befürwortende Haltung gänzlich mit der Publikation „Warum die\n        Fackel nicht erscheint“ (1934). Kraus’ darin geäußerte Kritik gegen die\n        Sozialdemokraten sowie die klare Positionierung für das Dollfuß-Regime\n        isolierten ihn schließlich noch mehr als sein Verstummen 1933.\n

Die unter dem Punkt <i>Der Vorleser</i> erstmals\n          vollständig publizierten Vorlesungsprogramme Karl Kraus’ sind aber\n          weiterhin unter folgender Adresse abrufbar:\n          <a\n            href=\"https://www.kraus.wienbibliothek.at/der-vorleser\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n            >https://www.kraus.wienbibliothek.at/der-vorleser</a\n          >.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Die Digitalisate der Rechtsakten aus der Kanzlei Oskar Samek wurden in\n          dem im September 2018 begonnenen Forschungsprojekt im Volltext\n          erschlossen, ediert und zum Teil auch schon ausgewertet. Die\n          Ergebnisse liegen nun in Form dieser wissenschaftlichen Edition vor.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Die Digitalisate sind einer Transkription synoptisch\n          gegenübergestellt. Der von der Text Encoding Initiative vorgegebene\n          Standard zur Auszeichnung von XML-Dokumenten wurde für das Projekt und\n          das zu edierende Material angepasst und optimiert. So ist die\n          Auszeichnung der Texte und in der Folge die Herstellung von Bezügen\n          zwischen den einzelnen Dokumenten und darüber hinaus ermöglicht.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Den Nutzerinnen und Nutzern wird der Zugang zu dem umfangreichen und\n          komplexen Material in mehrerer Hinsicht erleichtert:\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Über eine Auswahl verschiedener Themen (Kultur, Recht, Politik) kommen\n          die Benutzerinnen und Benutzer zu bestimmten Vorauswahlen von Akten,\n          die jeweils mit einem erläuternden Text der Herausgeber:innen versehen\n          sind.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Zusätzlich gibt es die Möglichkeit, sich Dokumente nach\n          handschriftlichen Kriterien gefiltert anzeigen zu lassen, da\n          nachträgliche handschriftliche Überarbeitungen von besonderer Relevanz\n          sein können. So kann unter anderem die Zusammenarbeit zwischen dem\n          Anwalt Oskar Samek und seinem Mandanten Karl Kraus studiert werden.\n        </p>\n        <p>Daneben lässt sich auch eine Liste aller Akten aufrufen.</p>\n        <p>\n          Darüber hinaus können die Nutzerinnen und Nutzer über einen\n          Handapparat auf mehrere Materialien zugreifen, welche die\n          Beschäftigung mit den Akten zusätzlich unterstützen. Beiträge zu\n          unterschiedlichen Aspekten der Edition und ihres Inhalts von Forschern\n          unterschiedlicher Disziplinen bilden einen Teil. Ein anderer Teil ist\n          Oskar Samek gewidmet und enthält einen biographischen Aufsatz sowie\n          ein Interviewtranskript. Und im dritten Teil wird die durch Hermann\n          Böhm verantwortete Print-Ausgabe der Rechtsakten aus den 1990er Jahren\n          für die Forschung bereitgestellt.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Daneben erhalten die Nutzerinnen und Nutzer aber auch die Möglichkeit,\n          über von <i>Karl Kraus Online</i> adaptierte, aktualisierte Statistiken eine\n          quantitative Auswertung zu den juristischen Delikten, Verfahren und\n          Prozessen zu erhalten. Ein Zeitstrahl bietet einen Überblick über die\n          gesamten 215 Akten.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Für das Projekt stand die Forschungsfrage im Zentrum, wie Karl Kraus’\n          Zitatverfahren und -strategien konkret aussahen. Wer spricht in den\n          Dokumenten, wer wird auf welche Weise zum Zeugen aufgerufen, und in\n          welchem Kontext stehen die Zitate? Wie verhalten sie sich zu Zitaten\n          in den anderen Texten von Kraus, welche Akten nahm Kraus später in\n          seine Zeitschrift <i>Die Fackel</i> auf und sind im Laufe der für Österreich\n          politisch bewegten 15 Jahre, über die sich die Rechtsakten erstrecken,\n          Veränderungen bemerkbar?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Die zahlreichen Auszeichnungen der edierten Dokumente (s.\n          Editionsrichtlinien) geben auf viele dieser Fragen konkrete Antworten\n          und legen gleichzeitig die Grundlage für weitergehende Forschungen.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Das Konzept der <i>Rechtsakten Karl Kraus</i> wurde am Ludwig Boltzmann\n          Institut for Digital History entwickelt und ausgeführt. Die technische\n          Umsetzung (Programmierung Backend/Frontend) ist am Austrian Centre for\n          Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage erfolgt, die Digitalisierung\n          und Bereitstellung der Rechtsakten ermöglichte die Wienbibliothek im\n          Rathaus.\n        </p>\n        </div>\n      </b-col>\n      <b-col cols=\"5\">\n        <Zitierempfehlung/>\n

The number of nuclear weapons is plotted on the Y-axis and the years on the X-axis. The chart is interactive, and the year-on-year stockpile levels can be traced for each country. The US has a stockpile of 6 nuclear weapons at the dawn of the nuclear age in 1945. This number has gradually increased to 369 by 1950 when the USSR enters the arms race with 6 weapons. At this point, the US starts to rapidly build its stockpile culminating in 32,040 warheads by 1966 compared to the USSR’s 7,089. From this peak in 1966, the US stockpile gradually decreases as the USSR’s stockpile expands. By 1978 the USSR has closed the nuclear gap at 25,393. The USSR stockpile continues to grow until it reaches a peak of 45,000 in 1986 compared to the US arsenal of 24,401. From 1986, the nuclear stockpiles of both countries start to fall. By 2000, the numbers have fallen to 10,577 and 21,000 for the US and Russia, respectively. The decreases continue until 2017 at which point the US holds 4,018 weapons compared to Russia’s 4,500.\",\n        },\n        title: {\n          text: this.title,\n        },\n        subtitle: {\n
